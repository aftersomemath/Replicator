This program makes copies of itself with random names in its home directory. It then runs those copies.

To stop the program you need to a create a file with the name STOP.txt in the directory you ran self_replicator in. Otherwise you will run out of hard drive space eventually.

Also if you want to open this in an IDE I included the .cpd for Codeblocks.
